# Travel-Tracker
Working with AI and Google Sheets
# Overview 
For this project, I worked with ChatGPT and google sheets to create a travel tracker. 
# Process
First, I learned how to use AI and Google Sheets by following along from last week's class. The example was birthday gift reminders. Then, I practiced with some of my own ideas to seee what I could do. I tried a grocery shopping tracker to plan for a 10 guest party dinner, and then I tried to create a recipe tracker. I found out that AI can actually give me really tasty recipes. However, I finally settled on a travel tracker, because I go on so many trips throughout the years. I need a tracker to log all my trips because my memory can blend those trips together or I just forget. I set a description of the trip, the start and end date and notes about the trip. The reminder is set to once a week on Sunday nights. With this tracker, I can log all my trips as I go on them this year. 
# Users
Anyone who travels and wants to keep track of all their fun trips
# Learnings
This was a big, complicated step to use AI and google sheets and coding. First, I watched some videos on how to do it. Later, I learned to cleary comminicate with Chatgpt and ask it questions, when I got stuck. For example, on my Google Aps Script page, the function tab read "Myfunction" instead of "Onopen." I asked chatgpt what to do, and I was able to follow the instructions. I was given several options, but I finally was able to see the problem and fix it. Now, my tracker functionally works and I am very happy and surprised with all that I learned and accomplished. <img width="1312" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 11 02 29 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9db94be7-e3a2-4a4e-9e07-2425c24a3856" /><img width="399" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 11 02 51 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93d4cb67-350d-4f85-bc15-b003a9b9c062" />
